![image](https://github.com/hattietc/TodoList-Medial/assets/69206124/1266eadc-6279-459f-b21c-152ab54aabcb)

The code is incomplete as the implementation required me to get up tp date with java for react and adding typescript to that mix.

USE CASES:
Use case 1:

On open, display heading, existing tasks and buttons.
		Props:
		States:
				

App function, via html, show heading etc to describe what is shown via mock up. Use add task function to display shortened list of tasks.

Use case 2:

Onclick createtasks, function to fill out form details and submit when complete
		Props:
				- 
		States:
				-

Onclick function : opens form function for input data
Form: dictates implicit types of props/states, eventhandles for on change and on submit, html code to define layout of form. 
Onsubmit function: send data from Formdata to task array to be used in main app function UseCase .

Use Case 3:

Update button points to update function which uses task unique id to. Go to task in array, open form for editing then

Components:

1. Main Page: contains all contents of app
2. Create Task Button: Opens form to fill in formData to be stored in array
3. Task List: Contains task title, edit, delete buttons and the progress status dropdown menu
